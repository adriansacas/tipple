## Differences/Deviations
- Password and Confirm Password text field in Register page has a 
'Cannot show Automatic Strong Passwords' error when setting isSecureTextEntry to true, will work on finding the solution to this by Beta
- In order for a user to update their email address they must re-authenticate and confirm their email first. However, can't seem to be able to send emails. Will investigate further.
